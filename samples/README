This folder contains a integration test suite for both client and server APIs.
A complete test run has following phases (executed when invoking 'python test.py'):

- setup: global variables are set (architecture, repositories, etc.) and
kickstart is generated in function (see setup.py). To override default settings,
create a 'var.py' file containing new settings.

- definition: ComodIT resources required for tests are defined but not yet
created (see definitions.py).

- creation: Resources described at definition phase are created (see create.py).

- provisioning: Host instantiated in creation phase is provisioned on libvirt
hypervisor provided at setup.

- testing: Integration tests described in 'test_*.py' files are executed. Each
test is composed of 3 steps: setup, run and tear_down.

- clean-up: Finally, all created resources are deleted and kickstart file
generated during setup is deleted.

Note that most phases may be executed separately by calling associated module.
