    """
    Defines the access point to a particular cortex server. An instance of
    CortexApi class may be used to retrieve, create, update and delete resources
    of the server (hosts, applications, etc.).

    Resources handled by the server may listed and accessed using collections.
    There is one collection by resource type (for example, all applications
    defined on a server are part of application collection).
    A collection getter is a method that provides an access point to a collection
    of resources. This class provides all collection getters. These methods
    are named as follows: get_*_collection where * is a resource type.

    Factory methods defined by this class allow to instantiate access points to
    resources (application, distribution, host, etc.) managed by a cortex server.
    These factory methods are named as follows: new_* where * is a resource type.

    Finally, this class defines getters that provide services implemented by the
    server or this client. Currently, 2 services are defined: the directory and
    the rendering service. The directory allows to retrieve the UUID of a
    resource given an identifier (a name or a path). The rendering service
    provides the result of templates' rendering for a particular host.
